Wednesday morning, Sept 6h, the assistant to the medical staff at  Parkview Neurology called me likely in response to message I had sent to
update them on my recent appointment with Dr. Karl. 

## Background to the Call

I had a follow up appointment the Wednesday before, on August 30th, with
Erin Richmond NP, who I seen for first time ever, on June 30th, when I established care with Parkview Neurology. They appointment was never scheduled to
include seeing one of the Parkview neurologists.

I was able to see Dr Austin three days after Richmond referred me to him. Dr. Austin told me that since I was an established patient of Dr. Karl, who also did
spinal stimulator implatation, and who Dr. Autin said was "equivaltent to me", I really should follow up with him. Unfortunetly, the earliest I could get in to see
Dr Karl (to discuss whether spinal cord stimulation was a realistic option for my pain) was September 1st. Dr Austin also told me that the four
main medications to treat peripheral neuropathy pain.

The appointment two and half weeks ago was very brief, half an appointment really, because I was fifteen minutes late. It told her that when I saw 

At the July 3rd appoint with with Dr Austin, he and I discusses what medications are used to treat neuropathy pain. He said that their are four main
medications: gabapentin, pregabapion (Lyrica), Cymbalta, and--I belive--amitriptyline. 

I saw Dr Karl, on Sept 1st, too, to talk the possibility of spinal cord stimulator. He wanted me first to try protriptyline 10mg because I told him
Amytripline caused terrible heatburn and nortriptyline made me wired.

I had a 2nd appt with Erin August 3oth, but it was only a "half appointment" because I wasn't on time. I told her Dr. Austin had recommended
I see Dr. Karl about the spinal cord stimulator because I already was an established patient of Dr Karl. But I couldn't get in to see
Dr. Karl until September 1st. She said to keep them update on that appointed, which I did using MyChart.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3459228/

You know, I don't really want to be going to two "doctors" for the same problem--getting two different medications from each. I think the reason
for the call was to inquire if I was taking both Lyrica and Gabapentin. I had experimented with lyrical at bedtime--in addition the the gabapetin--
and I told Dr. Karl this and he said he sometimes precribes both. He told me to just take gabapetin 3x day (as Erin Richmond prescribed), and he
alos prescribed gabapentin.

The upshot of the call was: I got to describe in detail the side effects--the worsening of my dry eye syndrome, the inability to read for
pleasure--that both anti-convusives like gabapentin and pregabalin and tricyclics like amytriptyline, nortriptyline, etc cause. 
I explained my medications history, how amtriptyline had caused me heartburn over 20 years ago, how I
have very bad dry eye syndrome because of LASIK. I told her my tear break up time was immediate, zero, following LASIK.

And during the German lesson the teacher and I discussed how medical care works in Germany. He told me that if you are in your
thirties ans suspect you might have blood sugar problems, you are likely to be told, no, that is not your problem.
The doctor will not even examine you. You must do your own research and even buy a blood sugar monitor to test your blood sugar
levels. Such devices are available in any drug store. His experience was very interesting. He even described a website where you can
rate your doctor. This website is affliated with the German equivalent of the AMA. If a doctor is "reviewed" unfavorably it
could eventually result his or her medical suspension.

A reader commented on above article:

> I don't believe this hype about another spinal stimulator. I've personally witnessed the harm these implanted machines cause from involuntary
electrocution to explosion. I have not witnessed any positive results. Again, it's advocacy for profit. We are now wise to the methods of these
psychopaths of creating profit at the expense of the desperately ill under the guise of some kind of medical altruism. The questions remain.
How many more pain patients have to die before it's been enough? How are we going to convince the psychopaths to allow us enough medication
legally to live? If the Mexican cartel is going to supply the pain patients that are left alive with medication as the DEA is reported to say, then where is the medication? Will all types be available? Not everyone can take or be relieved by fentanyl. These psychopaths are likely total sadist as well and there may be no end to this insanity.
