I had something unusual happen Wednesday morning, Sept 6h. Right after I finished with my online German lesson, the assistant to Erin Richmond, who is the nurse practitioner at Parkview that I'm seeing, called. She wanted to find what medications I'm taking. Am I
taking both pregabalin (Lyrica) and gabapentin. Dr. Karl had prescribed pregabalin in June, when we met to talk about the upcoming 
genicular nerve ablation of my right knee. 

I saw Dr Karl Sept 1st about the possibility of spinal cord stimulator. He wanted me first to try protriptyline 10mg--since Amytripline caused 
terrible heatburn and nortriptyline made me wired.

I had a 2nd appt with Erin August 3oth. It was very brief because I was late. I told her Dr. Austin had recommended
I see Dr. Karl about the spinal cord stimulator since I was an established patient of Dr Karl. But I couldn't get in until
September 1st. She said to keep them update on that appointed, which I did using MyChart.

I don't really want to be going to two "doctors" for the same problem--getting two different medications from each. I think the reason for the call
was to inquire if I was taking both Lyrica and Gabapentin. I had experimented with lyrical at bedtime--in addition the the gabapetin.

The upshot of the call was: I got to describe in detail the side effects--the worsening of my dry eye syndrome, the inability to read for
pleasure. To explain my medications history, how amtriptyline had caused me heartburn over 20 years ago, how I
have had bad dry eye syndrome because of LASIK. I told her my tear break up time was immediate.
