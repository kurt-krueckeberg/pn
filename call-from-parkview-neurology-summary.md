Wednesday morning, Sept 6h, Megan, an assistant to the medical staff at Parkview Neurology, called me in response to the two messages I had sent using
[Mychart.parkview.com](https://mychart.parkview.com) the week before, sent to update Erin Richmond, NP, the provider who I am seeing at Parkview Neurology,
on my appointment, on September 1, 2023, with Dr. Karl. I had seen Erin Richmon NP two days earlier, on August 30th, but because I was
fifteen minutes late, it was a very cursory appointment. Erin emphasized I should update her about the upshot of my appointment with Dr. Karl ("since he isn't in the
Parkview system.")

I think Megan, the Parkview Neurology staff assitant, had called me to find out what medications Dr. Karl had prescribed on September 1st Maybe
Kurt was mixing medications from two providers and he needed to be called and questioned.

I now don't really see much point in going both to a neurologist (or NP in a neurolgy practice). Pain doctors prescribe gabapentin and pregabalin, which
apparently are the only two drugs neuruolgy practices prescribe--althouh Dr. Baht did prescribe amytriptyline some months ago after I told night time
pain in my fingers and finger tips was ruining my sleep. Amytriptyline gave me terrible heartburn, and like all tricyclic antidepressants made my
dry eye worse. Gabapentin and pregablin also make my dyr eye worse. Even before getting on any medication for neuropathy pain, I never have been able 
to sleep through the night without putting in vicous eye drops.

## Background to the Call

I first met Erin Richmond NP for the first time, on June 30th, when I established care with Parkview Neurology. The Parkview Neurology appointment scheduler
never scheduled me one of the Parkview neurologists. At that first appointment with Erin, I told her gabapentin and pregabalin "worsened my dry eye, made
my eyes uncomfortable to the point that reading for pleasure, something I love, was nearly impossible" and "it made me stupid". That is the gist of what I
said. So she then referred me to to Dr. Ausin, a Parkview Pain Management physician, to discuss whether a spinal stimulator was an option. She said some
peripheral neuropathy patients had been helped by such a device (she didn't say how much).

I was diagnosed on June 28, 2021 with severe polyneuropathy and told two days later by Credo Medicine I need to see a neurologist for ongonig care. 

I was able to see Dr Austin three days after Erin Richmond referred me to him, on Jly 3rd, 2023. Dr. Austin told me that since I was an established patient
of Dr. Karl, who also did spinal stimulator implantation and who Dr. Austin said, "was equivaltent to me", I should follow up with Dr. Karl.
Unfortunately the earliest I could get in to see Dr Karl was in two months, on September 1st. 

Dr Austin also told me that the four main medications to treat peripheral neuropathy pain were  gabapentin, pregabapion (Lyrica), Cymbalta, and--I belive--amitriptyline. 

The appointment with Erin Richmond NO, on Agusut 30th, was supposed to be about what Dr. Austin said ("see Dr. Karl") but it was very brief,
reallu just half an appointment, because I was fifteen minutes late. It told her that would see saw Dr Karl in two days, on Sept 1st.

When I say Dr. Karl on September 1st, I told him amitriptyline (that Dr. Baht prescibed) had give me bad heartburn and nortiptyline (that Dr. Karl
had prescribed in 2022) gave me isomnia. I also told Dr. Karl that the medications I was taking worsened my dry eye. But I don't think the message
got through. The medications I am on are only moderately effective at controlling my night time pain. But there are worsening my quality of life
significantly. The hate these medications because my eyes irritable me all the time, and I can't read like I want.

Neurologists, family practice physican, nurses, psychologist had no clue how devastating dry eye syndrome is or what it feels like.
The first line medications for treating neuropathy are anticonvulsives, gabapentin and pregabalin, and tricyclic antidepressants, the main one
being amitriptyline, and other antidepressents like Effexor. These medications have known side effect of dry mouth.

I had a 2nd appt with Erin August 30th, but it was only a "half appointment" because I wasn't on time. I told her Dr. Austin had recommended
I see Dr. Karl about the spinal cord stimulator because I already was an established patient of Dr Karl. But I couldn't get in to see
Dr. Karl until September 1st. She said to keep them update on that appointed, which I did using MyChart.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3459228/

You know, I don't really want to be going to two "doctors" for the same problem--getting two different medications from each. I think the reason
for the call was to inquire if I was taking both Lyrica and Gabapentin. I had experimented with lyrical at bedtime--in addition the the gabapetin--
and I told Dr. Karl this and he said he sometimes precribes both. He told me to just take gabapetin 3x day (as Erin Richmond prescribed), and he
alos prescribed gabapentin.

The upshot of the call was: I got to describe in detail the side effects--the worsening of my dry eye syndrome, the inability to read for
pleasure--that both anti-convusives like gabapentin and pregabalin and tricyclics like amytriptyline, nortriptyline, etc cause. 
I explained my medications history, how amtriptyline had caused me heartburn over 20 years ago, how I
have very bad dry eye syndrome because of LASIK. I told her my tear break up time was immediate, zero, following LASIK.

And during the German lesson the teacher and I discussed how medical care works in Germany. He told me that if you are in your
thirties ans suspect you might have blood sugar problems, you are likely to be told, no, that is not your problem.
The doctor will not even examine you. You must do your own research and even buy a blood sugar monitor to test your blood sugar
levels. Such devices are available in any drug store. His experience was very interesting. He even described a website where you can
rate your doctor. This website is affliated with the German equivalent of the AMA. If a doctor is "reviewed" unfavorably it
could eventually result his or her medical suspension.

A reader commented on above article:

> I don't believe this hype about another spinal stimulator. I've personally witnessed the harm these implanted machines cause from involuntary
electrocution to explosion. I have not witnessed any positive results. Again, it's advocacy for profit. We are now wise to the methods of these
psychopaths of creating profit at the expense of the desperately ill under the guise of some kind of medical altruism. The questions remain.
How many more pain patients have to die before it's been enough? How are we going to convince the psychopaths to allow us enough medication
legally to live? If the Mexican cartel is going to supply the pain patients that are left alive with medication as the DEA is reported to say, then where is the medication? Will all types be available? Not everyone can take or be relieved by fentanyl. These psychopaths are likely total sadist as well and there may be no end to this insanity.
