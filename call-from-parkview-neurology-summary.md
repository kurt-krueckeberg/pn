Wednesday morning, Sept 6h, Megan, an assistant to the medical staff at Parkview Neurology, called me in response to the two messages I had sent using
[Mychart.parkview.com](https://mychart.parkview.com) the week before, to update Erin Richmond, NP, the provider who I am seeing at PArkview Neurology about my
neuropaty, on my appointment with Dr. Karl. I see Dr. Karl on September 1st. I had seen Erin Richmon NP two days earlier, on August 30th, but because I was
fifteen minutes late, it was a very cursory appointment. But Erin emphasized updating her about my appointment with Dr. Karl ("since he isn't in the
Parkview system.")

I think Megan had called me to find out what medications I Dr. Karl had Dr. Karl prescribed when I saw him on September 1st appointment? Maybe
she had concerns that I was mixing medications from two providers--who knows?

And I now don't really see much point in going to neurologist (or NP in a neurolgy practice). Pain doctors prescribe gabapentin and pregabalin, which
apparently are the only two drugs neruolgy practices prescript--althouh Dr. Baht did prescribe amytriptyline onths ago after I told night time
pain in my fingers and finger tip was ruining my sleep. Amytriptyline gave me terrible heartburn. And like all tricyclic antidepressants made my
dry eye worse. Gabapentin and pregablin also make my dyr eye worse. Even before getting on any medication for neuropathy pain, I never am able 
to sleep through the night without putting vicous eye drops in. 

## Background to the Call

I first met Erin Richmond NP for the first time, on June 30th, when I established care with Parkview Neurology. The Parkview Neurology appointment scheduler
never scheduled me one of the Parkview neurologists. At that first appointment with Erin, I told her gabapentin and pregabalin "worsened my dry eye, made
my eyes uncomfortable to the point that reading for pleasure, something I love, was nearly impossible" and "it made me stupid". That is the gist of what I
said. So she then referred me to to Dr. Ausin, a Parkview Pain Management physician, to discuss whether a spinal stimulator was an option. She said some
peripheral neuropathy patients had been helped by such a device (she didn't say how much).

I was diagnosed on June 28, 2021 with severe polyneuropathy and told two days later by Credo Medicine I need to see a neurologist for ongonig care. 
I now know that I could just have well gone to a pain doctor.

I was able to see Dr Austin three days after Richmond referred me to him. Dr. Austin told me that since I was an established patient of Dr. Karl, who also did
spinal stimulator implatation, and who Dr. Autin said was "equivaltent to me", I really should follow up with him. Unfortunetly, the earliest I could get in to see
Dr Karl (to discuss whether spinal cord stimulation was a realistic option for my pain) was September 1st. Dr Austin also told me that the four
main medications to treat peripheral neuropathy pain.

The appointment two and half weeks ago was very brief, half an appointment really, because I was fifteen minutes late. It told her that when I saw 

At the July 3rd appoint with with Dr Austin, he and I discusses what medications are used to treat neuropathy pain. He said that their are four main
medications: gabapentin, pregabapion (Lyrica), Cymbalta, and--I belive--amitriptyline. 

I saw Dr Karl, on Sept 1st, too, to talk the possibility of spinal cord stimulator. He wanted me first to try protriptyline 10mg because I told him
Amytripline caused terrible heatburn and nortriptyline made me wired.

I had a 2nd appt with Erin August 3oth, but it was only a "half appointment" because I wasn't on time. I told her Dr. Austin had recommended
I see Dr. Karl about the spinal cord stimulator because I already was an established patient of Dr Karl. But I couldn't get in to see
Dr. Karl until September 1st. She said to keep them update on that appointed, which I did using MyChart.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3459228/

You know, I don't really want to be going to two "doctors" for the same problem--getting two different medications from each. I think the reason
for the call was to inquire if I was taking both Lyrica and Gabapentin. I had experimented with lyrical at bedtime--in addition the the gabapetin--
and I told Dr. Karl this and he said he sometimes precribes both. He told me to just take gabapetin 3x day (as Erin Richmond prescribed), and he
alos prescribed gabapentin.

The upshot of the call was: I got to describe in detail the side effects--the worsening of my dry eye syndrome, the inability to read for
pleasure--that both anti-convusives like gabapentin and pregabalin and tricyclics like amytriptyline, nortriptyline, etc cause. 
I explained my medications history, how amtriptyline had caused me heartburn over 20 years ago, how I
have very bad dry eye syndrome because of LASIK. I told her my tear break up time was immediate, zero, following LASIK.

And during the German lesson the teacher and I discussed how medical care works in Germany. He told me that if you are in your
thirties ans suspect you might have blood sugar problems, you are likely to be told, no, that is not your problem.
The doctor will not even examine you. You must do your own research and even buy a blood sugar monitor to test your blood sugar
levels. Such devices are available in any drug store. His experience was very interesting. He even described a website where you can
rate your doctor. This website is affliated with the German equivalent of the AMA. If a doctor is "reviewed" unfavorably it
could eventually result his or her medical suspension.

A reader commented on above article:

> I don't believe this hype about another spinal stimulator. I've personally witnessed the harm these implanted machines cause from involuntary
electrocution to explosion. I have not witnessed any positive results. Again, it's advocacy for profit. We are now wise to the methods of these
psychopaths of creating profit at the expense of the desperately ill under the guise of some kind of medical altruism. The questions remain.
How many more pain patients have to die before it's been enough? How are we going to convince the psychopaths to allow us enough medication
legally to live? If the Mexican cartel is going to supply the pain patients that are left alive with medication as the DEA is reported to say, then where is the medication? Will all types be available? Not everyone can take or be relieved by fentanyl. These psychopaths are likely total sadist as well and there may be no end to this insanity.
