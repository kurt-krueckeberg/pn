Wednesday morning, Sept 6h, immediately after an online German lesson, the assistant to Erin Richmond NP (and likely others) of Parkview Neurology called.
I saw Erin on June 30th, 2023, and again on August 20th, which was only half an appointment because I was late. The "assistant"  wanted to find what
medications I'm taking. Am I taking both pregabalin (Lyrica) and gabapentin?

Dr. Karl had prescribed pregabalin in June, when we met before the genicular nerve ablation of my right knee, which occurred in mid July. 

I saw Dr Karl, on Sept 1st, too, to talk the possibility of spinal cord stimulator. He wanted me first to try protriptyline 10mg because I told him
Amytripline caused terrible heatburn and nortriptyline made me wired.

I had a 2nd appt with Erin August 3oth, but it was only a "half appointment" because I wasn't on time. I told her Dr. Austin had recommended
I see Dr. Karl about the spinal cord stimulator because I already was an established patient of Dr Karl. But I couldn't get in to see
Dr. Karl until September 1st. She said to keep them update on that appointed, which I did using MyChart.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3459228/

You know, I don't really want to be going to two "doctors" for the same problem--getting two different medications from each. I think the reason
for the call was to inquire if I was taking both Lyrica and Gabapentin. I had experimented with lyrical at bedtime--in addition the the gabapetin--
and I told Dr. Karl this and he said he sometimes precribes both. He told me to just take gabapetin 3x day (as Erin Richmond prescribed), and he
alos prescribed gabapentin.

The upshot of the call was: I got to describe in detail the side effects--the worsening of my dry eye syndrome, the inability to read for
pleasure--that both anti-convusives like gabapentin and pregabalin and tricyclics like amytriptyline, nortriptyline, etc cause. 
I explained my medications history, how amtriptyline had caused me heartburn over 20 years ago, how I
have very bad dry eye syndrome because of LASIK. I told her my tear break up time was immediate, zero, following LASIK.

And during the German lesson the teacher and I discussed how medical care works in Germany. He told me that if you are in your
thirties ans suspect you might have blood sugar problems, you are likely to be told, no, that is not your problem.
The doctor will not even examine you. You must do your own research and even buy a blood sugar monitor to test your blood sugar
levels. Such devices are available in any drug store. His experience was very interesting. He even described a website where you can
rate your doctor. This website is affliated with the German equivalent of the AMA. If a doctor is "reviewed" unfavorably it
could eventually result his or her medical suspension.
