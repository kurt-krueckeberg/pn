- [The Voice of the Patient: Neuropathic Pain Associated with Peripheral Neuropathy](https://www.fda.gov/files/about%20fda/published/The-Voice-of-the-Patient--Neuropathic-Pain-Associated-with-Peripheral-Neuropathy.pdf)
  - Excerpt relevant to me "Patient perspectives on **Pain**" that describes reports of _burning_, _numberness and tingling_,
    _electrical shock-like pain_, _stabbing pain_ ... and so on, including:

>  **sleep disturbance**:
    Several participants described issues with inconsistent sleep patterns and insomnia due to
    neuropathic pain. Many participants credited their lack of sleep to painful sensations occurring
    throughout the night. One participant noted, “Pain often wakes me very early, and as this has
    become a nightly experience, I now dread going to bed.” Another participant stated, “[once
    awakened by pain] getting back to sleep is not an option."

### Initial Search Results

Initially I searched [SciSpace at https://typeset.io](https://typeset.io/) asking these questions:

- [What are the Clinical Features of Idiopathic Neuropathy](https://typeset.io/search?q=What%20are%20the%20clinical%20features%20of%20idiopathic%20peripheral%20neuropathy?)

- [What are the treatment options for idiopathic neuropathy?](https://typeset.io/search?q=What%20are%20the%20treatment%20options%20for%20idiopathic%20peripheral%20neuropathy?)

- [Is there a relationship between high arches and idiopathic peripheral neuropathy?](https://typeset.io/search?q=Is%20there%20a%20relationship%20between%20high%20arches%20and%20idiopathic%20peripheral%20neuropathy?)
  I knew high arches accompany chronic neuropathy but didn't know why? I'm curious to know why that is. 

Located among other articles was a study of the relationship between [Peripheral Neuropahty and Cognitive Performance in the Elderly](https://typeset.io/papers/relationship-between-peripheral-neuropathy-and-cognitive-22jmkhi5gp)
with a rather depressing conclusion. Who wants to find that?

Also of interest:
