# Introduction

I began this website looking for relevant information. I found two newer websites I had never heard of designed to help one find the
most relevant scientific publications. I found these two sites mentioned by a professor of linguistics, whose video I had watched on
youtube. Go figure.

## Finding Relevant Scientific Literature 

To help you find the most relevant researh articles these sites use artifical intelligence (ChatGPT and likely special types of databases
). Both are currently free:

1. [elicit.org](https://elicit.org) 
2. [SciSpace (at https://typeset.io)](https://typeset.io/)

### Elicit.org

The Elict [FAQS page](https://elicit.org/faq#what-is-elicit) explains that

> Elicit is a research assistant using language models like GPT-3 to automate parts of researchersâ€™ workflows. Currently, the main workflow
in Elicit is Literature Review. If you ask a question, Elicit will show relevant papers and summaries of key information about those papers
in an easy-to-use table.

Elicit has a Youtube video on: [How to use Elicit for empirical research](https://youtu.be/IYvnivEl8Hw)

## SciSpace

SciSpace proved the more useful. It presented results in spreadsheet sort of way. You could then ask it to summarize key findings, give
major contributions, etc.
