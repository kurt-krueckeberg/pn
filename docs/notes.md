## Research Aids

## [elicit.org](https://elicit.org) 

[elicit.org](https://elicit.org) is free. As the FAQS page [explains](https://elicit.org/faq#what-is-elicit):

> Elicit is a research assistant using language models like GPT-3 to automate parts of researchersâ€™ workflows. Currently, the main workflow
in Elicit is Literature Review. If you ask a question, Elicit will show relevant papers and summaries of key information about those papers
in an easy-to-use table.

## Scispace [https://typeset.io/](https://typeset.io/)

It is also free.  It allows you to not only search for relevant scientific literature, but to then read it using AI, which I haven't tried.

## The Problem

Peripheral neuropathy can result in pain. This pain can be tolerable during the day, but intolerable at night because medication is not all that great in
controlling it. Although doctors may understand this, they don't always have much to help.
