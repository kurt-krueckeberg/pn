# Notes on PN

## Finding Relevant Scientific Literature 

These sites use AI to help you find relevant research articles. Both are currently free:

1. [elicit.org](https://elicit.org) 
2. [SciSpace](https://typeset.io/)

The Elict FAQS page [explains](https://elicit.org/faq#what-is-elicit):

> Elicit is a research assistant using language models like GPT-3 to automate parts of researchers’ workflows. Currently, the main workflow
in Elicit is Literature Review. If you ask a question, Elicit will show relevant papers and summaries of key information about those papers
in an easy-to-use table.

See also Elicit's Youtube video: [How to use Elicit for empirical research](https://youtu.be/IYvnivEl8Hw)

[SciSpace](https://typeset.io/) goes even further with "AI" and helps you better comprehend articles.

Here are two questions I asked on SciSpace:

- [What are the Clinical Features of Idiopathic Neuropathy](https://typeset.io/search?q=What%20are%20the%20clinical%20features%20of%20idiopathic%20peripheral%20neuropathy?)

- [What are the treatment options for idiopathic neuropathy?](https://typeset.io/search?q=What%20are%20the%20treatment%20options%20for%20idiopathic%20peripheral%20neuropathy?)

- [Is there a relationship between high arches and idiopathic peripheral neuropathy?](https://typeset.io/search?q=Is%20there%20a%20relationship%20between%20high%20arches%20and%20idiopathic%20peripheral%20neuropathy?)
  I knew high arches accompany chronic neuropathy but didn't know why? I'm curious to know why that is. 

Located (among others) was an article the study the relationship between [Peripheral Neuropahty and Cognitive Performance in the Elderly](https://typeset.io/papers/relationship-between-peripheral-neuropathy-and-cognitive-22jmkhi5gp)

Also of interest:

[Emerging therapies for neuropathic pain: new molecules or new indications for old treatments?](https://typeset.io/papers/emerging-therapies-for-neuropathic-pain-new-molecules-or-new-35onfglesz)
mentions oxcarbazepine has recetly shown to be helpful in PN pain.

[Relation of Exercise and Pain in Patients with Idiopathic Distal Axonal Polyneuropathies](https://typeset.io/papers/relation-of-exercise-and-pain-in-patients-with-idiopathic-1wvbknmogh)

## What is my Problem?

Peripheral neuropathy has imparied coordination in my feet and ankles so I need a walker or a cane to get around. I also have noticed over the last
several months a lose of normal coordination in my hands.

But PN has also brought altered sensation and in the last year this has gotten worse in my hands, mainly the ends of my thumb and index finger, which are
controlled by the mediam nerve (which happens to be the nerve compressed in carpal tunnel syndrome). This hass become the biggest problem because my
sleep is affected every single night. 

Gabapentin is only moderated helpful. I was prescribed two 600mg a day, but I started taking and extra one at night, and it still didn't do enough.
I also have an Rx for pregabalin (Lyrica) I am also taking that at night. One doctor told me
not to take both. But I don't care. I'm just wanting to sleep normally, not begin my day at 4am or 2:30am.

However, both of these medications make my dry eye worse. They make my eyes more uncomfortable and I can't enjoy reading. I'm trying to have as normal
a life as possible and they side effects are worsing my occular surface disease. They make you tired, too. If I take two gabapentin (one taken in the evening
or at bedtime, and then another around 3 or 4 or 5am) and a 75mg pregablin at bedtime, I not clear-headed until about 1pm. 

So what I really want is to be able to go to Germany and know I won't experience terrible discomfort in my lower legs and feet from sitting for hours.
And I want to know I can sleep normally once I get there. I want to be able to use the computer without my right hand bothering me,

I do have terrible back pain, I don't take narcotics. Do I have to have to get a spinal stimulator, a gizmo implanted in my lower back that I might feel,
in order to do something as "simple" as flying to Germany (or anywhere else) and using my hands normally (normal for me) without worse dry eye? 

Are Elicit or SciSpace going to magically deliver the answer? Or any other the links below? There just aren't a lot of options--it seems?
