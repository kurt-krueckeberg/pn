# Notes on PN

## Finding Relevant Scientific Literature 

To help you find the most relevant researh articles these sites use artifical intelligence (ChatGPT and likely special types of databases
). Both are currently free:

1. [elicit.org](https://elicit.org) 
2. [SciSpace](https://typeset.io/)

### Elicit.org

The Elict [FAQS page](https://elicit.org/faq#what-is-elicit) explains that

> Elicit is a research assistant using language models like GPT-3 to automate parts of researchers’ workflows. Currently, the main workflow
in Elicit is Literature Review. If you ask a question, Elicit will show relevant papers and summaries of key information about those papers
in an easy-to-use table.

Elicit has a Youtube video on: [How to use Elicit for empirical research](https://youtu.be/IYvnivEl8Hw)

### SciSpace at <https://typeset.io/> 

[SciSpace at https://typeset.io](https://typeset.io/) goes further with "AI" to help you better comprehend articles it finds. For example,
here are two questions I asked on SciSpace:

- [What are the Clinical Features of Idiopathic Neuropathy](https://typeset.io/search?q=What%20are%20the%20clinical%20features%20of%20idiopathic%20peripheral%20neuropathy?)

- [What are the treatment options for idiopathic neuropathy?](https://typeset.io/search?q=What%20are%20the%20treatment%20options%20for%20idiopathic%20peripheral%20neuropathy?)

- [Is there a relationship between high arches and idiopathic peripheral neuropathy?](https://typeset.io/search?q=Is%20there%20a%20relationship%20between%20high%20arches%20and%20idiopathic%20peripheral%20neuropathy?)
  I knew high arches accompany chronic neuropathy but didn't know why? I'm curious to know why that is. 

Located among other articles was a study of the relationship between [Peripheral Neuropahty and Cognitive Performance in the Elderly](https://typeset.io/papers/relationship-between-peripheral-neuropathy-and-cognitive-22jmkhi5gp)
with a rather depressing conclusion.

Also of interest:

[Emerging therapies for neuropathic pain: new molecules or new indications for old treatments?](https://typeset.io/papers/emerging-therapies-for-neuropathic-pain-new-molecules-or-new-35onfglesz)
mentions oxcarbazepine has recetly shown to be helpful in PN pain.

[Relation of Exercise and Pain in Patients with Idiopathic Distal Axonal Polyneuropathies](https://typeset.io/papers/relation-of-exercise-and-pain-in-patients-with-idiopathic-1wvbknmogh)

## What is my Problem?

Peripheral neuropathy has imparied coordination in my feet and ankles so I need a walker or a cane to get around. I also have noticed over the last
several months a loss of normal coordination in my hands.

But PN has also brought altered sensation and in the last year it has gotten worse in my hands. This hass become the biggest problem because my
sleep is affected every single night. I'm taking a combination of gabapentin and lyrica, something I was told not to do. But I don't care.
I'm just wanting to sleep normally, not begin my day at 4am or 2:30am.I don't like taking these medications because they make by already bad dry
eye worse. I cant readily read for pleasure anymore. And they are only moderately effective.

No one told me to take a gabapentin in the evening (or at bedtime), then a pregabalin (Lyrica) at bedtime, then, when I inevitably wake up with 
soreness at the end of my fingers, to take another gabapentin. I still struggle to sleep because of this "soreness" mostly the end of my index finger and
thumb, mainly my right hand. This is problem is worse in direct proportion to how much (and it doesn't take much) I do things like keyboard
typing. 

These medications also make you tired.
 
So what I really want is to be able to go to Germany and know I won't experience terrible discomfort in my lower legs from sitting for hours on the plane.
I want to know I can sleep normally once I get there. I want to be able to use the computer without my right hand bothering me.

However, I do not have terrible back pain; I don't take narcotics. Do I have to have to get a spinal stimulator, a gizmo implanted in my lower back that I
might constantly feel, in order to do something as "simple" as flying to Germany (or anywhere else) or to use my hands normally without worse dry eye or
feeling tired? 

And it seems, if I a deemed a candidate for a spinal stimulator, and undergo all the discomfort of undergoing the one week trial, it isn't guarantted to work
no matter how badly one wants it to.

Are Elicit or SciSpace going to magically deliver the answer of what to do? Or any of other the links below? There just aren't a lot of options--it seems?
I just want to get on with life.
