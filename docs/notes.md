## Scientific Research Aided by AI

The discovery of relevant research aided by AI at
Both of these sites are currently free:

1. [elicit.org](https://elicit.org) 
2. [SciSpace](https://typeset.io/)

The Elict FAQS page [explains](https://elicit.org/faq#what-is-elicit):

> Elicit is a research assistant using language models like GPT-3 to automate parts of researchersâ€™ workflows. Currently, the main workflow
in Elicit is Literature Review. If you ask a question, Elicit will show relevant papers and summaries of key information about those papers
in an easy-to-use table.


[SciSpace](https://typeset.io/) allows you to not only search for relevant scientific literature, but to then read and better comprehend with the help of
AI.

Two questions I posed on SciSpace:

- [What are the Clinical Features of Idiopathic Neuropathy](https://typeset.io/search?q=What%20are%20the%20clinical%20features%20of%20idiopathic%20peripheral%20neuropathy?)

- [What are the treatment options for idiopathic neuropathy?](https://typeset.io/search?q=What%20are%20the%20treatment%20options%20for%20idiopathic%20peripheral%20neuropathy?)

## What is the Problem?

I have experienced imparied coordination in my feet and ankles and I need a walker or a cane to get around. But I also have noticed a lose of
normal coordination in my hands.

PN has also brought experinced altered sensation and this has gotten worse in my hands...

Peripheral neuropathy can result in pain. This pain can be tolerable during the day, but intolerable at night because medication is not all that great in
controlling it. Although doctors may understand this, they don't always have much to help.
