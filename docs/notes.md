## Scientific Research Aided by AI

These sites use AI to help you find relevant research articles. Both are currently free:

1. [elicit.org](https://elicit.org) 
2. [SciSpace](https://typeset.io/)

The Elict FAQS page [explains](https://elicit.org/faq#what-is-elicit):

> Elicit is a research assistant using language models like GPT-3 to automate parts of researchers’ workflows. Currently, the main workflow
in Elicit is Literature Review. If you ask a question, Elicit will show relevant papers and summaries of key information about those papers
in an easy-to-use table.


[SciSpace](https://typeset.io/) goes even further: it helps you better comprehend articles.

Here are two questions I asked on SciSpace:

- [What are the Clinical Features of Idiopathic Neuropathy](https://typeset.io/search?q=What%20are%20the%20clinical%20features%20of%20idiopathic%20peripheral%20neuropathy?)

- [What are the treatment options for idiopathic neuropathy?](https://typeset.io/search?q=What%20are%20the%20treatment%20options%20for%20idiopathic%20peripheral%20neuropathy?)

- [Is there a relationship between high arches and idiopathic peripheral neuropathy?](https://typeset.io/search?q=Is%20there%20a%20relationship%20between%20high%20arches%20and%20idiopathic%20peripheral%20neuropathy?)

Located (among others) was an article the study the relationship between [Peripheral Neuropahty and Cognitive Performance in the Elderly](https://typeset.io/papers/relationship-between-peripheral-neuropathy-and-cognitive-22jmkhi5gp)

Also of interest:

[Emerging therapies for neuropathic pain: new molecules or new indications for old treatments?](https://typeset.io/papers/emerging-therapies-for-neuropathic-pain-new-molecules-or-new-35onfglesz)
mentions oxcarbazepine has recetly shown to be helpful in PN pain.

## What is my Problem?

Peripheral neuropathy has imparied coordination in my feet and ankles so I need a walker or a cane to get around. I also have noticed over the last
several months a lose of normal coordination in my hands.

PN has also brought altered sensation and in the last two years this has gotten worse in my hands and has become the biggest problem.

The discomfort in my feet and lower legs worsens through the day. 

Peripheral neuropathy can result in pain. This pain can be tolerable during the day, but intolerable at night because medication is not all that great in
controlling it. Although doctors may understand this, they don't always have much to help.
