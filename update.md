# The Problem

## The Rambling Discouse Below

I got agitated last week and captured what was running around in my head.  Who even does this sort thing? What as mess neuropathy and the "treatments" has
caused.

## "Dear Diary"

I have peripheral neuropathy that has gotten to the point that I have trouble walking and by 11am my foot and lower legs get really uncomfortable and that grows worse as 
the day progresses. I cope with this by walking every day on the treadmill at the YMCA for .9 miles. Every night before bed, I rub my foot and ankles with capsaicin cream.
Thankfully my feet up to now don't cause terrible problems when I sleep, but my hands do.

I am also taking gabapentin and other medicines and they are causing intolerable worsening of my dry eye. And I want to get off such medicines because they make my eyes
terribley uncomfortable and I can't really even read for pleasure, something I love and would do every do.

Severe dry eye syndrome is not like having dry skin. Eye drops don't replace the lack of natural tears. I have had dry eye disease since having LASIK in 2003. In the months
following LASIK, I was also diagnosed with [Superficial Punctate Keratitis](https://www.allaboutvision.com/conditions/cornea/punctate-keratitis/). Spots on my cornea
where the cells had become so dry they were damaged. You can't read much at all. To "read" I had to listen to audiobooks.

Now I am taking gabapentin, prescribed by Parkview Neurology currently. Dr. Karl prescribed an tricyclic protriptyline. I told him
amitriptyline caused me bad hearburn and the nortriptyline he had prescribed (at a follow up foloowing my first kneee ablation) made me "wired" when I 
took it before bed. 

But anticonvulsives, like gabapentin and pregabllin (Lyrica), and tricyclic medications, like amitriptyline (or nortriptyline, protriptyline) all have known side effects
of dry mouth. If you are someone with bad dry eye like me, that all means they will make your dry eye worse. This medications are making my dry eye intolerable. I want to
get off them in the worse way. How do you do that but sleep through the night? My hand, mainly my finger and espeically the ends of my fingers, go "to sleep". I wake up
at 3am or 4am groggy, turn over in the bed, then predicatably feel the tingling and in my fingers and the soreness at the end of my fingers (mainly the middle finger and 
thumb, and it is worse in my right hand). 

I am not at all crazy about the idea that the "solution" is to have wires surgically inserted into my spine, and a battery implanted in my lower back (which would only
be done after one-week trial showed the spinal stimulator was truly helpful). I don't want that. I just want to sleep at night and not have my eye comfort (which
has never been normal since LASIK) back.

Doctors who aren't eye care professionals don't have never probably heard of eye break up time (my tear break up time following LASIK was 0 seconds, immediate). The --
I imagine -- have never had a neuropathy patient who also has bad dry eye made much worse by the medications they are prescribing.

I am now seeing both a nurse practioner at Parkview Neurology who has precribed 600mg of gabapentin 3x/day, and I am also seeing Dr. Jon Karl, a pain doctor at
Orthopedics North East. I am an established patient of Dr. Karl. He did a nerve ablation (for the 2nd time in two years) of the genicular nerve(s) of my right knee.
And since he also does spinal cord simulators, I am seeing him about that (but it hasn't been seriously considered yet).

Do I really need two "doctors" for one peripheral neuropathy? Since Dr. Karl is not part of the Parkview system and since gabapentin is now a controlled substance,
that increases (I imagine) the burden of the nurse practioner at Parkview Neurology. She needs to kept abreast of what medications Dr. Karl might
prescribe. 

## A "Typical" Week

Wednesday morning, Sept 6h, Megan, an assistant to the medical staff at Parkview Neurology, called me in response to the two messages I had sent using
[Mychart.parkview.com](https://mychart.parkview.com) the week before, sent to update Erin Richmond, NP, the provider who I am seeing at Parkview Neurology,
on my appointment, on September 1, 2023, with Dr. Karl. I had seen Erin Richmon NP two days earlier, on August 30th, but because I was
fifteen minutes late, it was a very cursory appointment. Erin emphasized I should update her about the upshot of my appointment with Dr. Karl ("since he isn't in the
Parkview system.")

I think Megan, the Parkview Neurology staff assitant, had called me to find out what medications Dr. Karl had prescribed on September 1st Maybe
Kurt was mixing medications from two providers and he needed to be called and questioned.

I now don't really see much point in going both to a neurologist (or NP in a neurolgy practice). Pain doctors prescribe gabapentin and pregabalin, which
apparently are the only two drugs neuruolgy practices prescribe--althouh Dr. Baht did prescribe amytriptyline some months ago after I told night time
pain in my fingers and finger tips was ruining my sleep. Amytriptyline gave me terrible heartburn, and like all tricyclic antidepressants made my
dry eye worse. Gabapentin and pregablin also make my dry eye worse. Even before getting on any medication for neuropathy pain, I never have been able 
to sleep through the night without putting in vicous eye drops.

## Background to the Call

I first met Erin Richmond NP for the first time, on June 30th, when I established care with Parkview Neurology. The Parkview Neurology appointment scheduler
never scheduled me too see a Parkview neurologist. At that first appointment with Erin, I told her gabapentin and pregabalin "worsened my dry eye, made
my eyes uncomfortable to the point that reading for pleasure, something I love, was nearly impossible" and "it made me stupid". That is the gist of what I
said. So she then referred me to to Dr. Ausin, a Parkview Pain Management physician, to discuss whether a spinal stimulator was an option. I was thnakful
I was being considered for another option (but not crazy about having wires and a battery pack installed in my back). She said some
peripheral neuropathy patients had been helped by such a device (she didn't say how much).

I was diagnosed on June 28, 2021 with severe polyneuropathy and told two days later by Credo Medicine I needed to follow up with a neurologist for ongonig care. 

I was able to see Dr Austin three days after Erin Richmond referred me to him, on July 3rd, 2023. Dr. Austin told me that since I was an established patient
of Dr. Karl, who also did spinal stimulator implantation and who Dr. Austin said, "was equivaltent to me", I should follow up with Dr. Karl.
Unfortunately the earliest I could get in to see Dr Karl was in two months, on September 1st. 

Dr Austin also told me that the four main medications to treat peripheral neuropathy pain were  gabapentin, pregabapion (Lyrica), Cymbalta, and--I belive--amitriptyline.
He said pregabalin was "a step up." But I haven't found it much different that gabapentin. 

After seeing Dr. Austin, I picked up the prescription that Dr, Karl had written for Lysica back in mid June, when I had a consultation prior to the
genicular nerve ablation of my right knee that took place in mid July. During that appointment I had asked him about the differene between Lyrcia and
gabapentin. I don't remember what he said. I think he first tried gabapentin with patients. He then wrote an Rx for Lyrica and said, "pick it up if 
want to try it." So I went and picked up the Lyrica (but did so only after the July 3rd appointment with Dr. Austin). Lyrica made my eyes dry. Yuck.
Dry eye isn't dry skin that is helped with hand lotion. Eye drops don't retore eye comfort, except briefly.

So if you have bad dry eye like me, you don't want to take any medications that make it worse like those I am taking for neuropathy or for sleep
related neuropathy pain that is a big, big problem.

Back in mid August I talked all this over with Dr. Moran, my primary care doctor. He said it was too bad that amitriptyline caused heartburn since
it is a go-to medication for pain and the dosage can also be increased as needed. He also said, "I wouldn't see Dr. Austin. He tries to get people
off of medications." He mentioned his dad was seeing Dr. Barr (for, I think, compression fractures? in his back), and he had good things to say
about Dr. Barr, who is with ONE.

The appointment with Erin Richmond NO, on Agusut 30th, was supposed to be about what Dr. Austin said ("see Dr. Karl") but it was very brief,
reallu just half an appointment, because I was fifteen minutes late. It told her that would see saw Dr Karl in two days, on Sept 1st.

When I say Dr. Karl on September 1st, I told him amitriptyline (that Dr. Baht prescibed) had give me bad heartburn and nortiptyline (that Dr. Karl
had prescribed in 2022) gave me isomnia. I also told Dr. Karl that the medications I was taking worsened my dry eye. But I don't think the message
got through. The medications I am on are only moderately effective at controlling my night time pain. But there are worsening my quality of life
significantly. The hate these medications because my eyes irritable me all the time, and I can't read like I want.

Neurologists, family practice physican, nurses, psychologist had no clue how devastating dry eye syndrome is or what it feels like.
The first line medications for treating neuropathy are anticonvulsives, gabapentin and pregabalin, and tricyclic antidepressants, the main one
being amitriptyline, and other antidepressents like Effexor. These medications have known side effect of dry mouth.

I had a 2nd appt with Erin August 30th, but it was only a "half appointment" because I wasn't on time. I told her Dr. Austin had recommended
I see Dr. Karl about the spinal cord stimulator because I already was an established patient of Dr Karl. But I couldn't get in to see
Dr. Karl until September 1st. She said to keep them update on that appointed, which I did using MyChart.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3459228/

You know, I don't really want to be going to two "doctors" for the same problem--getting two different medications from each. I think the reason
for the call (From Megan, the Parkview Neurology staff assistant) was to inquire if I was taking both Lyrica and Gabapentin. I had experimented with lyrical at
bedtime--in addition the the gabapetin--and I told Dr. Karl this, and he said he sometimes precribes both medications. He told me to just take gabapetin 3x
a day (as Erin Richmond prescribed), and he also prescribed 10mg of nortriptyline. I tried it one night. It didn't help and it gave
me epigastic pain after I swallowed a gabapentin around 3am. I told ONE this via their patient portal on September 7th. So Dr. Karls's PA
prescribed cymbalta. I told them it gives insomnia. So the prescribe--guess--Effexor, anti-depressant, a class of medication that worsens
dry eye.

I think I also too it once like ten years ago in Dallas. It caused me heartburn.

Back to the call from Megan. It was pleasantly surprised that she listened for ten mintues while I described in detail the side effects--the worsening
of my dry eye syndrome, the inability to read for pleasure--that both anti-convusives like gabapentin and pregabalin and tricyclics like amytriptyline, nortriptyline, etc cause. 
I explained that LASIK resulted in bad dry eye and now medications like gabapentin, lyrica, etc make my eyes really uncomfortalbe; how amtriptyline had caused
me heartburn over 20 years ago. I even explained what "tear break up time" was. That instead of the normal 30 seconds my tear-brekup time was immediate, zero seconds,
following LASIK.

And during the German lesson the teacher and I discussed how medical care works in Germany. He told me that if you are in your
thirties ans suspect you might have blood sugar problems, you are likely to be told, no, that is not your problem.
The doctor will not even examine you. You must do your own research and even buy a blood sugar monitor to test your blood sugar
levels. Such devices are available in any drug store. His experience was very interesting. He even described a website where you can
rate your doctor. This website is affliated with the German equivalent of the AMA. If a doctor is "reviewed" unfavorably it
could eventually result his or her medical suspension.

  A reader obviously disgrunted commented on the above article characterizing it as misleading marketing:
> I don't believe this hype about another spinal stimulator. I've personally witnessed the harm these implanted machines cause from involuntary
electrocution to explosion. I have not witnessed any positive results. Again, it's advocacy for profit. We are now wise to the methods of these
psychopaths of creating profit at the expense of the desperately ill under the guise of some kind of medical altruism. The questions remain.
How many more pain patients have to die before it's been enough? How are we going to convince the psychopaths to allow us enough medication
legally to live? If the Mexican cartel is going to supply the pain patients that are left alive with medication as the DEA is reported to say, then where is the medication? Will all types be available? Not everyone can take or be relieved by fentanyl. These psychopaths are likely total sadist as well and there may be no end to this insanity.
